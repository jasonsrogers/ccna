# TCP/IP and OSI

Model used today is TCP/IP or TCP stack

Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol 

OSI is a model that is used to describe how data is sent over a network, it didnd't win but it's still used somehow

## TCP/IP

we use TCP/IP to send data over the internet via ip addresses

application 
transport
network                                     layer 3
physical (sometimes data link + physical)   layer 1 + layer 2

## OSI

open systems interconnection

works the same way as TCP/IP but it's a different model

application
presentation
session
transport
network
data link
physical

main difference is that OSI has a presentation layer and a session layer

layer 1 2 3 4 are the same

but layer 5 6 7 are different but will always call application layer 7 even in tcp/ip

### nemonics OSI

7 -> 1 
All people seem to need data processing

1 -> 7
