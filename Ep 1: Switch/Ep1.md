## notes

layer 2 mac address frame

layer 3 ip address packet

`show mac-address-table` show mac address table on the switch

difference between hub and switch
hub is a layer 1 device, switch is a layer 2 device
hub broadcast all packets to all ports
switch only broadcast to the port that the destination mac address is on

caveat wireless access point is a layer 2 device that behaves like a hub as it broadcasts all packets to all ports
